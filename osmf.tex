The OpenStreetMap Foundation is an
international non-profit organization
supporting, but not controlling,
OpenStreetMap. We are dedicated to
encouraging the growth, development and
distribution of free geospatial data and to
providing geospatial data for anyone to use
and share.

We need you as member. Members are vital
to the OSM Foundation -- to voice ideas
and shape the direction of the Foundation,
and support efforts of working groups. We
welcome all who support our goals to join us!

Find out more and join at osmfoundation.org
or join the session \emph{Get involved in the OpenStreetMap Foundation} on Saturday on 17:40.
